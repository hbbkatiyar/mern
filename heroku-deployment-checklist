******* Deployment Checklist ******* 
1. Dynamic Port Binding => Heroku tells us which port our app will use, so we need to make sure we listen to the port they tell us to.
    How? Please look into index.js file, There we have already handled this dynamic port biniding 

2. Specify Node Environment => We want to use a specific version of node, so we need to tell Heroku which version we want.
    How> Please look in package.json file, There we have mentioned engines object to handle this.

3. Specify start script => Instruct Heroku what command to run to start our server running
    How? Please look in package.json file again. There we have mentioned "start" key within "scripts" object for this.

4. Create .gitignore file => We don't want to include dependencies, Heroku will do that for us.
